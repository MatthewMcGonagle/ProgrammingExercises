# Programming Exercises

The purpose of this project is to be a collection of solutions to programming exercises.
The solutions are split into directories based on language.
In particular, there are many C++ solutions to problems from [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) in the directory [/cpp/](https://github.com/MatthewMcGonagle/ProgrammingExercises/tree/master/cpp). 

The solutions are self-contained. They will compile to create executables for testing; this is despite the fact that Leet Code only requires one to implement individual class member functions.

# Blog Entries 

Some of the solutions to the exercises are discussed on my blog; here is a list of the solutions 
that are discussed as blog entries:

* [C++ Solution for Leet Code 297: Serialize/Deserialize a Binary Tree](https://matthewmcgonagle.github.io/blog/2017/11/08/CppLeetCode297).
