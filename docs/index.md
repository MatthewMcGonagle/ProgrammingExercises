title: Programming Exercises
---

The purpose of this project is to be a collection of solutions to programming exercises.
The solutions are split into directories based on language.
In particular, there are many C++ solutions to problems from [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) in the directory [/cpp/](https://github.com/MatthewMcGonagle/ProgrammingExercises/tree/master/cpp). 

The solutions are self-contained. They will compile to create executables for testing; this is despite the fact that Leet Code only requires one to implement individual class member functions.

Some of the solutions to the exercises are discussed on my blog; here is a list:
